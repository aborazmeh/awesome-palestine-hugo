We encourage everyone to join and contribute.

We want to gather as many valuable resources as possible for anyone who wants to learn about Palestine.

## Guidelines

Anyone is welcome to contribute, but here are some guidelines to consider:

- Only add valuable resources; make sure the resource adds value to the readers or followers.
- Only authorized resources; we need authorized sources that are proven not to spread fake news.
- No propaganda; there is a lot of propaganda websites and social accounts, please add objective sources only.

## How

The easiest way is to go to the list [blob page](https://github.com/aborazmeh/awesome-palestine/blob/main/README.md) and click on the "pen" icon in the upper right corner. Make the changes to the file and follow the instructions to create a pull request.

## Recommendations

For the sake of consistency, it's highly recommended to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and to install the recommended extensions.

To do that, open the extension pane (usually `Ctrl+Shift+x`) and type `@recommended`, and install the listed extensions, then install `npm` packages via `npm install` or any equivalent you use.
